U.S. Digital Response \(USDR\) has acquired comprehensive software tool knowledge through many varied projects, software evaluations, and usage as we worked with hundreds of cities, counties, and states around the country. Choosing a tool for a project is no small feat; the success of a project depends on it. Our insights from research suggest that many project leaders spend a lot of time searching, comparing, and choosing software tools without necessarily looking at every angle, consideration, and best practices.

There are many important considerations to deliberate while researching and evaluating software tools, so we are sharing our knowledge with a set of key questions and best practices to help you make a sound decision. With this guide, government IT and Product departments have a solid approach to evaluate, identify, and defend the choice of software tools to build an effective and sustainable solution.
